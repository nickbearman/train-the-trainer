This is a general discussion of the topics of the day, focused on the
history of why we stream and record, how we got here, and how people
feel about it.  We won't focus on how anything is done.



## What is streaming and recording?

- Streaming is mass communication: one to many
  - Interaction audience→presenters is more limited (but different)
- Using consumer-grade tools, normal people can reach huge audiences
  by Twitch/YouTube/etc.
- This isn't actually that hard: people with much less training than
  us do it all the time.
- They reach huge audiences and maintain engagement for long events.

**Recording and rapid video editing is useful even without
streaming.**


## How did we get to the current state

- In-person workshops
  - 3 × full day, required travel, infrequent, one-shot
- Covid and remote teaching
  - Traditional "Zoom" teaching several times
- Mega-CodeRefinery workshop
  - 100-person Zoom teaching
  - Emphasis on teams
- Research Software Hour
  - Livestream free-form discussions on Twitch
- Streamed "HPC Kickstart" courses



## Benefits and disadvantages

Benefits:

- Larger size gives more (but different) interaction possibility
  - "Notes" for async Q&A
- Recording (with no privacy risk) allows instant reviews
- Stream-scale allows for many of the things you have learned about in
  days 1-3.

Disadvantages:
- Requires training for using the tools
- Requires a certain scale to be worth it
- Coordination is much harder for big events


## Future prospects (briefly)

- Streaming probably stays as a CodeRefinery tool
- We *can* scale our courses much larger than they are now.  Why don't
  we, together with others?


## Q&A



:::{keypoints}
- Streaming isn't that hard to understand
- There are benefits and disadvantages
